## About The Project

![Human Budget Screenshot][product-screenshot]


Human Budget is a budgeting webapp that gives the users the ability of budgeting their monthly expenses in categories so they can clearly know how much money are they spending in each category and how much do they have left to freely spend, save or invest. 

Human Budget achieves its goal by allowing the users to track their list of incomes and expenses every month.
